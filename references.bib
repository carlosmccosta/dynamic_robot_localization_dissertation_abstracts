@article{Tamaki2010,
abstract = {In this paper we propose CUDA-based implementations of two 3D point sets registration algorithms: Soft assign and EM-ICP. Both algorithms are known for being time demanding, even on modern multi-core CPUs. Our GPUbased implementations vastly outperform CPU ones. For instance, our CUDA EM-ICP aligns 5000 points in less than 7 seconds on a GeForce 8800GT, while the same implementation in OpenMP on an Intel Core 2 Quad would take 7 minutes.},

@article{Sturm2012,
abstract = {We present an approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for RGB-D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. Our system concurrently estimates the trajectory of a hand-held Kinect and generates a dense 3D model of the environment. We present the key features of our approach and evaluate its performance thoroughly on a recently published dataset, including a large set of sequences of different scenes with varying camera speeds and illumination conditions. In particular, we evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and processing time for three different feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, and ORB). The experiments demonstrate that our system can robustly deal with difficult data in common indoor scenarios while being fast enough for online operation. Our system is fully available as open-source.},

@article{Pomerleau2011,
abstract = {The increasing number of ICP variants leads to an explosion of algorithms and parameters. This renders difficult the selection of the appropriate combination for a given application. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art, modular, and efficient implementation of an ICP library. We took advantage of the recent availability of fast depth cameras to demonstrate one application example: a 3D pose tracker running at 30 Hz. For this application, we show the modularity of our ICP library by optimizing the use of lean and simple descriptors in order to ease the matching of 3D point clouds. This tracker is then evaluated using datasets recorded along a ground truth of millimeter accuracy. We provide both source code and datasets to the community in order to accelerate further comparisons in this field.},
